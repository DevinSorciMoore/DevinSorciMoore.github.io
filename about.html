    <h1 class=" Greatness">About me </h1>
    <p class="about">My name is Devin.I play basketall at SLZ ( San lornezo highschool) I really love the sport and every rule to it. Basketball is my way out of the negatve and a way to really be me and express myself </p>

    <h1 class= "Greatness"> <ul> <h1>What am I striving for?</h1> </ul>
  <ul>  <h2>What is the reason to strive<h2>   </ul>
    <ul>  <h3> Who is a role model<h3>    </ul>
    <p class="about">I am interested in lots of things. Those things vary from science-math to what construct do people have to become successful</p>
    <b>Why become successful? What does that bring?</b>
<p> Success brings money and money brings awareness and help. If im able to make lots of profit then i'll be able to make impacts in people with lower income a chance to succeed. Because it is extremley hard to make it out of the hood. So we need to start rebuilding the hood. Making it a place for success. Teaching my young brothers and sisters that they are talented and that they can be somebody in this world! </p> 

    <p class="about"> I feel like being successful is a thing almost everyone should aim for! Like there should be a reason for doing stuff, and ifyou do it then you should do it good! </p>
     And I simply say it brings graceness. Being able to prove yourself and prove that your someone, man thats the world!</p>
<em>The question is am I going to become successful? My perception is to keep grinding and dont quit. Because once you quit its over. You have to keep your head up and challenge yourself . </e>
