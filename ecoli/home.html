<h1>Why did we want to persue studying E.coli?<h1>
<p> We wanted to pursue E.coli because we thought that it needed to be noticed. E.coli is a dangerous bacteria in some conditions</p>
<p>People really need to know about E.coli and the posiblitys of it. It's incredible dangerous esspecially to the low iincome resisdents.</p>
<p>It could be a bigger impact on there health and over time become so detrimental that it possibly leads them to dying.</p>
<p> As we know the lower income has less access to antiboitics and are more prone to viruses and diseases!</p>
<p>Me and my group presented a solution on how we mayu fix this. We present a filiter. A filter than cleanses the bacteria and overall makes the bacteria unrelevant anymore. </p>
