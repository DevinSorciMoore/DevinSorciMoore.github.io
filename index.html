<ul><h2>Here is something that enspires me!</h2></ul>
<h3> Im an African American man and I attend UC Berkeley, one of the greatess public schools in the nation. In this poem I want to adress alot of problems that our "United States"Is going through.</h3>
      <h1>Black is Strong</h1>
      <div class="background1">
 <p> Our country or should we say there country.<br> I wish I could say this is my country but do I really want to?<p>
      <p>The United States of America makes 5% of the world and has nearly 21% of the worlds prisoners. Does that sound United to you !</p>
      <p>Hold on wait but we are suppose to " Make America great again"  but when was it ever great? Oh wait it wasnt we had
        23 prisions made since 1980 and only one college. Oh wait thats ok that our justice system .</p> <p> I mean I want all my brothers to achieve
        but before that we need to believe, but how are they finna believe if they locked up behind bars being called "crimnals, villians, assualters"<br>
        And now they becoming to believe that they cannot achieve because people are putting in there mind that they arent human, That they are horrible people<br>
        But look at this was this sysytem really meant to achieve? I mean the statstics show it themselves. <em>The United states spends 182 Billion dollars on prisions every year!</em></p>
        <p> What that says to me is there ajective is to have and KEEP my brothers in there. They want them in the cell. The Government is makeing a cylce and we are falling into it<br>
          we need to break these bonds break these thoughts and become something. This world wasnt made for us.... we were made for this world. And it was made for us to put everything back together<br>
          We were raped, hit, abused, beaten, Threatened, but look at us now. We are still here together We are the People that are UNINTED we make the US UNited. <br>
          "because if I ruled the world... I free all my sons" Lets be somebody thats what my grandma always told me...  ANd thats what im doing. What are you... be the change!<p>
<ul><h2> We should be treated equal and our justice system needs to be fixed. It isnt right </h2> </ul>
<ol> If congress won't do anything we have to. Its up to us to do something. Nothing is handed tous we need to keep pushing and fight for what sright </ol>
