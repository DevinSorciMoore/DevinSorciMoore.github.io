<p>  Hi my name is Devin moore and I am a future stem graduate! A carreer I really want to explore is Science and business. </p>
<p> In the science major I want to emphazize human nature and really uplift the study of biology and physics! Im very much aware that these two majors most likely are very imapcted with there class rooms.</p>
<p> I am currently in a stem program for 3 years and 5 weeks during the summer! This program is helping me achieve my prosporous goals. I am also ataining lots of role models and really impressive firends with me . I aquired lots of knowledge and ways how to interact!</p>
<p> I believe I grown tremendously from the begginning of the year and I keep accumalting goals and more comminicatable tecniques!</p>
 <p> I really want to go to Morehouse college! I want to be surrounded by people who look like me and want the same education as me! I would love to go to Morehouse college and I would most likely get into it because of my academics and sports!</p>
<p>I've participated in plenty of community acts. Even when I was little I would sell lemonade or even go around making cookies to go around. That all was a way to build community. Im a big part of my community and out of it.  </p>
<p> I like to perform in plays like drama. So im extremly good with talking to people.</p>
<p> I would be a extrmely smart and trustworthy choice to be accepted to morehouse because I want to attain plenty of goals in my future. I will strive for success and bring other with me.</p>
