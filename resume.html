<p>  Hi my name is Devin moore and I am a future stem graduate! A carreer I really want to explore is Science and bussiness. </p>
<p> In the science major I want to emphazize human nature and really uplift the study of biology and physics! Im very much aware that these two majors most likely are very imapcted with there class rooms.</p>
<p> I am currently in a stem program for 3 years and 5 weeks during the summer! This program is helping me achieve my prosporous goals. I am also ataining lots of role models and really impressive firends with me . I aquired lots of knowledge and ways how to interact!</p>
<p> I believe I grown tremendously from the begginning of the year and I keep accumalting goals and more comminicatable tecniques!</p>
